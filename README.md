# AzerothLib
AterothLib is a library written in C++ to connect to a AzerothCore (Wow private server based on WotLK) and update the players position and send spellcasts and the like to the server. It mimics the Wow.exe and can be used for MMORPG games which are similar to Wow.
You could use it for example with an Unreal Engine based game.
